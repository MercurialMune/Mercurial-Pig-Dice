# The Mercurial JavaScript Quiz Board


## Project Description

This project enables a user to play a two-player dice game known as pig. When a user clicks roll, a die is cast and lands on one of six faces. if the face it lands on is not a "one", the user gets another chance to play. the user does this recursively until he or she decides to click hold, in which case all the scores will be added; or until the user's die lands on a one, at which point all the accumulated points will be deleted. At this point, the user's opponent can play the next round. the games should go like this until one of the players reach a 100 points, where the player is declared the winner.

## Deployment

To deploy the program, stage it on Git and push it to GitHub. Then, create a gh-pages branch from your master branch in the local machine. Thereafter, push the project to gh-pages on GitHub. After that, the program will be ready for Deployment on Git Hub Pages

The live page can be found in the following link: [The Mercurial Pig Dice](https://mercurialmune.github.io/Mercurial-Pig-Dice/)

* After Deployment, the following image shows what the expected output would be.

## Behavior Driven Development
  As with any other reputable development project, the Mercurial Pig Dice Game followed a systematic process between its conceptualization stage and its actual implementation. First, it was considered that users needed to perform certain tasks. However, due to the simplicity of the program, there wasn't much users could do with it. However, it was assumed that in the least, users should:


  | Behavior                            | Specification                               |
  | ------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------:|
  | Provide a play area                 | Use Divs to mark area outline               |
  | Provide input element for playing   | Provide buttons                             |  
  | Display the Winner                  | Provide forms                               |
